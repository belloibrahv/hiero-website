## 🎉 Introducing GitHub Reactions for Blog Posts

We're excited to announce a new feature that enhances community engagement on our blog posts! The GitHub reactions system allows community members to react to blog posts using the same reaction system they're familiar with from GitHub.

## ✨ How It Works

This feature automatically fetches reactions from GitHub Pull Requests and displays them on blog posts. Users can see community reactions (thumbs up, heart, rocket, etc.) and click through to the GitHub PR to add their own reactions.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Reactions**: See current reaction counts from GitHub
- **Automatic PR Discovery**: If no PR number is specified, the system automatically searches for PRs that modified the blog post
- **Smart Caching**: Implements intelligent caching to respect GitHub API rate limits
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all device sizes

## 🚀 Supported Reaction Types

The system supports all standard GitHub reactions:
- 👍 thumbs up
- 👎 thumbs down
- 😄 laugh
- 🎉 hooray
- 😕 confused
- ❤️ heart
- 🚀 rocket
- 👀 eyes

## 📱 Try It Out

Below this post, you'll see the GitHub reactions component in action. It will automatically load reactions from PR #456 (this demo post's PR number).

The component shows:
- A loading state while fetching reactions
- Real-time reaction counts from GitHub
- A link to the GitHub PR for adding reactions
- Graceful fallbacks if no reactions are found

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

This feature is built using:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: GitHub REST API
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching with 30-minute TTL
- **Fallbacks**: Automatic PR discovery and error handling

## 🌟 Benefits

- **Community Engagement**: Measure what resonates with readers
- **No Backend Required**: Leverages existing GitHub infrastructure
- **Real-time Data**: Always up-to-date reaction counts
- **User Experience**: Familiar interface for GitHub users

## 📖 Usage

To enable reactions on your blog post, simply add a `pr_number` field to the frontmatter:

```yaml
+++
title = 'Your Post Title'
pr_number = "123"  # GitHub PR number
+++
```

If no PR number is specified, the system will automatically search for PRs that modified your blog post file.

## 🎯 What's Next

This is just the beginning! Future enhancements could include:
- GitHub token support for higher rate limits
- Real-time updates via GitHub webhooks
- Analytics integration
- Custom reaction types
